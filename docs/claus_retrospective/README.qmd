# PyWeek #34

A personal (and incomplete) retrospective

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/135241/189221169-7431e9c2-c468-442b-9096-ad84c2c187cb.gif)

*Joint presentation & discussion with thp at meetup.*

---

# It was awesome!

🌱 🍅 🪰 🪐 🚀 🕹️ 🥳

Let's do that again.

---

## Retrospective 🤔

Typical questions:

* What did I like?
* What did I learn?
* What did surprise me?
* What would I do differently next time?
* What made me think?

*A few selected aspects.*

---

## Idea Generation ✨

* [Initial issue](https://github.com/PyUGAT/pyweek34/issues/2) (see references therein)
* [Initial discussion](https://github.com/PyUGAT/pyweek34/tree/main/docs/init_discussion)
  * Sharing of ideas
  * Experimenting with stories
  * Final "10 minute to prepare pitch and then present your idea" to make decision

It was beautiful to see how a simple keyword "The Red Planet"
inspired so many ideas!

---

## Being Open for Ideas vs. Limiting Complexity ⚙️

For me tricky to balance.

---

## Coordination & Communication 🗨️

* GitHub
  * Targeted issues
  * Newsfeed issue to keep everyone in the loop
    * Post intermediate updates...
* Daily at 20:00 for those who can join

Worked well.
Outreach issues (easily accessible) were not answered.

---

## Documentation 📝

* Make is easier for other so see what happens and join
* Becomes outdated easily
* Is anyone reading it? Does the potentially joining person even exist?

Tricky to balance.

---

## Technical Collaboration 💻

* Personal folder for initial experiments
* Everyone on `main` (with brief `pull-commit-push` cycle)
* Personal meeting in Metalab (without meeting though ;)

Worked well.
Fast development pace makes it difficult for later comers to join?

---

## Complexity :

* Different coordinate systems
* Rotation
* Zoom
* Camera views
* Performance optimization

Many aspects to consider...

---

## Team 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

* Very valuable to have someone with experience 😉
* Varied resources vs. time frame

---

## Style & Art 🎨

* Images, sounds, ...
* Obviously very important but even more important than I thought.
* Fun to work on artistic aspects.

Nice opportunity to include others.

---

## Playtesting I 🕹️

* Does the game make sense?

In my opinion the idea of the game had to change slightly
to introduce competition "player vs. flies".
Was not obvious initially - too carried away by the idea?
Interesting to see.

---

## Playtesting II 🕹️

* Introduced various ways to speed up

That was very helpful because after some time it's
surprisingly annoying to experiment.

---

## Playtesting III 🕹️

* Is it fun?
* Is it self explaining?
* Does it work?
* What happens when someone who is not familiar with game plays it?

Interesting to see contrast, apparently not everything *obvious*.
Requires people.
Would be nice to have more time for that.
