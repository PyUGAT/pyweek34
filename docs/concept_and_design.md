# Red Planted Design Considerations

This document is a work in progress.
It aims to facilitate collaboration and make it easier
to join our project.

## Game Objective

Tend to your plants, defend you garden against nasty fruit flies
and harvest as many tomatoes as possible.

![Overview](init_discussion/red_planted.png)

Dynamics:
* You can grow your garden by tending to it.
* You need to defend your fruits against fruit flies.
* Fruit flies reproduce (if the find more food) -- in subsequent levels, maybe they get reinforcements (new spaceship, etc..)

*Thought: this sounds like an unstable ecosystem :D*

## User Interactions

As a user you can
* Plant seeds (do you buy seeds with the "tomato score money"?)
* Water the plants (unlimited water supply?)
* Scare aways (kill?) fruit flies with Good Old Martian Fruit Fly Repellent Spray(tm) -- modeled after Batman Shark Repellent spray?
* Hit (kill?) fruit flies with a fly flap
* Harvest (pick) tomatoes -- if you don't harvest, flies eat it or they spoil and drop to the floor (increases ground fertility? attracts flies?)
* Cut off plants -- scissor tool? (needs to be done for spoiled/dead plants, also for plants that have been fully harvested)
* Maybe throw tomatoes at fruit flies as an additional bonus interaction if there's time

Harvesting tomatoes earns you *tomato scores*! (love it!)

## Objects

Our world consists of...

**The red planet**
- Forms the center of the coordinate system
- Has a water level (that plants draw from) -- or do plants have their own "ground water" in the spot? so that watering a plant makes sense?)

**Plants**
- Has a location
- Needs water (and light), possibly nutrients from the ground (= ground fertility)
- Grows organically based on algorithmic generation
- Evolves, states: seed, seedling, plant, dead (?)

**Tomatoes**
- Grow on plants
- Attract flies
- Evolves, states: green, yellow, red

**Fruit flies**
- Has a location (is there a 'source' location, some kind of "fruit fly house"? or maybe a "fruit fly spaceship" in orbit?)
- Moves at random (needs SOME kind of state machine probably, e.g. "roam around", "get hungry", "fly towards fruit", "eat", "go back to spaceship?")
- Is attracted to tomatoes (how?)

## Technical Aspects

The planet coordinate system is the global coordinate system.
Planet coordinates are [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system), i.e.
- r: radius
- phi: angle (in degree (not radians) because pygame like degrees)

![Cartesian and polar coordinates](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Polar_to_cartesian.svg/1024px-Polar_to_cartesian.svg.png)

Objects (plants, flies, tomatoes, â€¦) that live on the planet, use the planet's coordinate system (is this useful? might make sense that some things just use local coordinates, but are "grafted" to a certain location on the planet.

Every object we want to draw needs a `draw(self, context)` method. The "context" provides high-level drawing and can abstract away things like assets, planet scrolling, etc.. -- scene can be drawn "once" to the context and then we can draw the scene from the context multiple times (e.g. zoomed-in view and zoomed-out view).

Every object has an `update(self)` method -- delta time could be passed in or we just grab the time from some global game object?
